# Supervised Learning Project 2

This repo contains the code for the implementations of various classifiers
on the popular MNIST dataset. `source_code_p1.ipynb` contains the code for 
implementing a kernel perceptron and running multiple experiments on the dataset.
`source_code_p2.ipynb` contains the manual implementations for 4 basic algorithms:
the perceptron, the winnow, least squares regression and K-nearest Neighbors. Lastly,
`p1_svm_manual_implementation.ipynb` contains a manual implementation of the support vector
classifier, which is connected to the task in `source_code_p1.ipynb`.

The results for all my models are accessible in the folders `part_1_results/` and `part_2_results/`.

For a detailed discussion of my methods and results, checkout my report
in `report.pdf`.
